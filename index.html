	<h1>American Sign Language (ASL) Basics</h1>
		<p>American Sign Language is used commonly throughout North America amongst people with hearing impairments. It is also used in other parts of the world and generally considered to be the most universal version of sign language. In addition to being used to help people with hearing impairments, some people teach basic ASL signs to their babies before they can speak as a way for them to better communicate.</p>
